Today, this has increased to 43 kilograms (about 95 pounds) — and this number is still set to increase. <br/> <br/><br/>If plastic consumption increases at its current rate, according to National Geographic, by 2050 there will be 12 billion metric tons of plastic in landfills.",

It’s because plastic breaks up into tiny pieces in the sea, which are then consumed by fish and other sea animals.<br/> <br/><br/> By 2050, virtually every seabird species on the planet will be eating plastic.",
